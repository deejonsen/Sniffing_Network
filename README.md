# Sniffing_Network# Network Security Lab Exercise: Sniffers for Network and Protocol Analysis

## Overview  
This lab exercise demonstrates the use of network sniffers (**Wireshark** and **tcpdump**) to capture, analyze, and extract information from network traffic. The exercise focuses on identifying protocols (HTTP, DNS, TCP), observing TCP handshakes, and detecting security risks like plaintext credentials.

## Learning Objectives  
By the end of this lab, you will:  
- Capture network traffic using **tcpdump** and **Wireshark**.  
- Analyze common protocols (HTTP, DNS, TCP).  
- Identify source/destination IPs, ports, and TCP handshakes.  
- Extract sensitive data (e.g., credentials) from unencrypted traffic.  

---

## Prerequisites  
- **Wireshark** installed on your machine.  
- **tcpdump** (Linux/Kali VM recommended).  
- Access to a test network (e.g., `localhost/dvwa`).  
- Basic terminal/command-line knowledge.

## Lab Tasks  

### Step 1: Packet Capture  
1. Use `tcpdump` to capture traffic on the `eth0` interface:  
   ```bash
   sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -nn -v -w capture.pcap



   Stop the capture with Ctrl+C after generating traffic.

Step 2: Traffic Generation
Generate test traffic by:

Visiting http://localhost/dvwa/login.php in a browser.

Running ping google.com and nslookup example.com in the terminal.

Sending a test HTTP POST request with credentials.

Step 3: Protocol Analysis
Open capture.pcap in Wireshark.

Apply filters to isolate traffic:

http.request: View HTTP GET/POST requests.

dns: Analyze DNS queries/responses.

tcp.port == 80: Inspect TCP handshakes.

Step 4: Data Extraction
Identify HTTP headers (Host, User-Agent).

Locate unencrypted credentials in POST requests.

Note DNS responses (e.g., example.com â†’ 93.184.216.34).

Conclusion
This lab highlights the importance of encrypting network traffic (e.g., using HTTPS) and the risks of unsecured protocols like HTTP. Key takeaways:

Sniffers like Wireshark are essential for traffic analysis and threat detection.

Unencrypted traffic exposes sensitive data (credentials, headers, etc.).

Always validate network security configurations to prevent data leaks.
